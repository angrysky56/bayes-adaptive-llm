This is just a mock demo that showcases the architectural concepts but doesn't include an actual working model. The demo currently:

1. **Uses mockups instead of real components:**
   - The "tokenizer" is just a simple string splitter that doesn't actually tokenize text
   - The embedding function is keyword-based rather than using actual neural embeddings
   - The model generates predetermined responses based on simple pattern matching
   - The SVF implementation doesn't actually train or meaningfully modify model weights

2. **Simulates the pipeline without real learning:**
   - It demonstrates the flow of the Bayesian controller selecting experts
   - It shows how expert vectors would theoretically be combined
   - It illustrates the decision-making process for expert selection

## Creating a Real Implementation

To transform this into a working model that can actually learn and remember, someone would need to:

### 1. Integrate a Real Language Model

```python
# Instead of the mock MambaFormer, use an actual model
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B")
```

### 2. Implement Real SVD Operations on Model Weights

```python
def apply_svd_to_layer(layer):
    # Extract weight matrix
    W = layer.weight.data
    
    # Compute SVD
    U, S, Vh = torch.linalg.svd(W, full_matrices=False)
    
    # Store original components
    layer.register_buffer('U', U)
    layer.register_buffer('S', S)
    layer.register_buffer('Vh', Vh)
    
    # Add hooks to modify S during forward pass
    def forward_hook(module, input, output):
        # Apply expert-specific modifications to S
        modified_S = module.S * module.expert_vector
        # Reconstruct weight with modified S
        W_modified = module.U @ torch.diag(modified_S) @ module.Vh
        # Return modified output
        return F.linear(input[0], W_modified, module.bias)
    
    layer.register_forward_hook(forward_hook)
```

### 3. Train Real Expert Vectors

```python
def train_expert_vector(model, dataset, expert_name, learning_rate=1e-4, epochs=3):
    """Train an expert vector on a specific domain dataset."""
    # Initialize expert vector as ones (identity transformation)
    expert_vector = {
        layer_name: torch.ones_like(layer.S) 
        for layer_name, layer in get_svd_layers(model)
    }
    
    # Optimizer that only updates the expert vector, not the base model
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam([expert_vector[name] for name in expert_vector], lr=learning_rate)
    
    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for batch in dataloader:
            # Forward pass with expert vector
            outputs = model(**batch, expert_vector=expert_vector)
            loss = outputs.loss
            
            # Backward pass and update
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    # Save trained expert vector
    torch.save(expert_vector, f"experts/vectors/{expert_name}/expert.pt")
```

### 4. Build a Real Embedding System

```python
def get_prompt_embedding(text, model):
    """Get actual semantic embedding for a prompt."""
    # Tokenize and encode
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
    
    # Get model embeddings from last hidden state
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs, output_hidden_states=True)
        # Use mean pooling over last layer
        embeddings = outputs.hidden_states[-1].mean(dim=1)
    
    return embeddings
```

### 5. Implement a Learning Memory System

```python
class AdaptiveMemory:
    def __init__(self, base_model):
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.expert_vectors = {}
        self.interaction_history = []
        
    def learn_from_interaction(self, prompt, response, feedback_score):
        """Learn from each interaction to improve future responses."""
        # Extract features from the interaction
        prompt_embedding = get_prompt_embedding(prompt, self.base_model)
        
        # Update expert vectors based on feedback
        for expert_name, expert_vector in self.expert_vectors.items():
            # Calculate influence of this expert on the response
            influence = calculate_expert_influence(expert_name, prompt_embedding)
            
            # Update expert vector based on feedback (positive reinforcement)
            if feedback_score > 0.7 and influence > 0.3:
                # Strengthen components that worked well
                self.strengthen_expert_components(expert_name, prompt_embedding)
            
        # Store interaction in history
        self.interaction_history.append({
            "prompt": prompt,
            "response": response,
            "feedback": feedback_score,
            "timestamp": time.time()
        })
        
    def strengthen_expert_components(self, expert_name, prompt_embedding):
        """Strengthen expert vector components that are relevant to the prompt."""
        # Implement gradient-based updates to specific singular values
        # based on their contribution to the response
```

### 6. Integrate with Real-world Usage and Feedback

For the system to truly learn and remember, it would need:

1. **A feedback mechanism** to evaluate response quality
2. **Long-term storage** of expert vectors and interaction history
3. **Periodic retraining** to consolidate learning
4. **A forgetting mechanism** to prioritize recent and important information

Error: The size of tensor a (512) must match the size of tensor b (256) at non-singleton dimension 0

The error you're seeing is because the expert vectors and model layers have mismatched dimensions (512 vs 256). In a real implementation, you would need to either:

1. Ensure dimensions match by adapting the expert vectors to the specific model architecture
2. Implement projection mechanisms to handle dimension mismatches
3. Train expert vectors specifically for your model architecture

## Challenges in Building a Real System

Creating a truly adaptive model involves overcoming several challenges:

1. **Catastrophic forgetting**: Ensuring new learning doesn't overwrite previous expertise
2. **Transfer learning efficiency**: Making adaptation fast with minimal data
3. **Memory limitations**: Managing the growing collection of expert vectors
4. **Computational overhead**: Balancing adaptation quality with inference speed
5. **Privacy considerations**: Handling sensitive information in the adaptation process

The mock demo provides a conceptual framework, but implementing a production-ready system would require significant engineering effort and research advancements in neural network adaptation techniques.

## What would be required to implement a production-ready Bayesian adaptive LLM system

## Production Implementation Requirements for Bayesian Self-Adaptive LLM

Based on my analysis of the repository code, the framework combines MambaFormer (a hybrid architecture with Mamba state-space models and Transformer attention) with Singular Value Fine-tuning (SVF) and a Bayesian controller for expert vector adaptation. Here's what's needed to create a production-ready system:

### 1. Model Architecture Implementation

The repository contains a mock implementation of MambaFormer. For a production system, you'd need:

- **Complete MambaFormer Implementation**: The existing implementation already includes SVDLinear, SVDMamba, and MultiHeadAttention classes with proper SVD operations, but uses simplified state-space modeling. A production version would need a more accurate implementation of the Mamba selective state space mechanics.

- **SVD Optimization**: The current SVD operations are implemented with PyTorch's `torch.linalg.svd` which can be slow and memory-intensive for large matrices. Production would need optimized SVD implementations, possibly with:
  - Truncated SVD approximations
  - Distributed SVD computation
  - GPU-optimized implementations

- **Incremental SVD**: The current caching implementation in the SVDMamba class needs further optimization to support efficient inference at scale. This requires careful management of state vectors during streaming generation.

### 2. SVF Training Pipeline

The repository includes the framework for SVF but doesn't show the actual training loop:

- **RL-based Training**: Implement the REINFORCE algorithm for training SVF vectors on domain-specific tasks as described in the Transformer¬≤ paper
  
- **Distributed Training**: Scale training across multiple GPUs/nodes
  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Systematic search for optimal SVF training parameters
  
- **Training Data Pipeline**: Curated datasets for each domain expert, with filtering and quality control

### 3. Bayesian Dispatch System

The BayesianController is implemented but needs several enhancements:

- **Advanced Evidence Collection**: Replace the mock embedding calculation with real semantic embeddings
  
- **Prior Learning**: The system should learn better priors based on usage patterns
  
- **Hierarchical Bayesian Models**: Support for hierarchical expertise across domains
  
- **Scalable Expert Storage**: Managing hundreds or thousands of expert vectors efficiently

### 4. Inference Optimization

The current demo uses a mock tokenizer and doesn't demonstrate real inference:

- **Two-Pass Optimization**: The system performs two passes (first for expert selection, second for generation). This needs to be optimized to minimize overhead.
  
- **KV Cache Management**: Properly reuse key-value caches between the two passes to avoid redundant computation
  
- **Batch Processing**: Support for batched inference to maximize throughput
  
- **Expert Vector Caching**: Cache frequently used expert vector combinations

### 5. Production Infrastructure

Beyond the core algorithms, a production system would need:

- **Expert Vector Management**: Versioning, lifecycle management, and optimization of expert vectors
  
- **Deployment Infrastructure**: Containerization, orchestration, and scaling
  
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Tracking adaptation quality, inference latency, and system health
  
- **Feedback Loop**: Collecting user feedback to continuously improve experts
  
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Testing different expert vectors and adaptation strategies

### 6. Memory Management

The system will need careful memory management:

- **Quantization**: The SVF vectors and model weights should be quantized (INT8, INT4) for efficiency
  
- **Pruning**: Remove unnecessary expert components that contribute little to performance
  
- **Weight Sharing**: Share components between experts where appropriate
  
- **Memory-Efficient SVD**: Implement memory-efficient SVD operations, possibly with streaming computation

### 7. Research Advancements

Several research advances would significantly improve the system:

- **Optimal Expert Initialization**: Better initialization strategies for SVF experts
  
- **Cross-Architecture Transfer**: Methods to transfer expert knowledge between model architectures
  
- **Continuous Learning**: Online updating of expert vectors during deployment
  
- **Meta-Learning for Adaptive Control**: Learning optimal adaptation strategies from data

## Implementation Strategy

To build this system, I recommend:

1. **Start with a Standard Base Model**: Begin with a well-tested model like Llama, Phi, or Mistral

2. **Implement SVF First**: The SVF algorithm is the core innovation and should be implemented first

3. **Build Single-Expert Systems**: Train and validate individual domain experts before combining

4. **Add Simple Bayesian Dispatch**: Implement the basic dispatch mechanism before adding sophistication

5. **Gradually Scale**: Start small and scale components as they prove effective

6. **Benchmark Against LoRA**: Compare against the industry standard LoRA for few-shot adaptation

## Unique Engineering Challenges

The most significant challenges in this implementation are:

1. **SVD Efficiency**: Computing SVD for large matrices efficiently during training and inference

2. **Adaptation Overhead**: Minimizing the computational cost of the two-pass inference system

3. **Expert Compatibility**: Ensuring that expert vectors are composable and don't interfere with each other

4. **Scaling Laws**: Determining how many experts are optimal and how they should be combined

5. **Memory Management**: Efficiently storing and retrieving potentially thousands of expert vectors

These challenges would require significant engineering effort beyond standard LLM development, but the potential benefits of a truly adaptable LLM system make it worthwhile.
