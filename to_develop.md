This is just a mock demo that showcases the architectural concepts but doesn't include an actual working model. The demo currently:

1. **Uses mockups instead of real components:**
   - The "tokenizer" is just a simple string splitter that doesn't actually tokenize text
   - The embedding function is keyword-based rather than using actual neural embeddings
   - The model generates predetermined responses based on simple pattern matching
   - The SVF implementation doesn't actually train or meaningfully modify model weights

2. **Simulates the pipeline without real learning:**
   - It demonstrates the flow of the Bayesian controller selecting experts
   - It shows how expert vectors would theoretically be combined
   - It illustrates the decision-making process for expert selection

## Creating a Real Implementation

To transform this into a working model that can actually learn and remember, someone would need to:

### 1. Integrate a Real Language Model

```python
# Instead of the mock MambaFormer, use an actual model
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B")
```

### 2. Implement Real SVD Operations on Model Weights

```python
def apply_svd_to_layer(layer):
    # Extract weight matrix
    W = layer.weight.data
    
    # Compute SVD
    U, S, Vh = torch.linalg.svd(W, full_matrices=False)
    
    # Store original components
    layer.register_buffer('U', U)
    layer.register_buffer('S', S)
    layer.register_buffer('Vh', Vh)
    
    # Add hooks to modify S during forward pass
    def forward_hook(module, input, output):
        # Apply expert-specific modifications to S
        modified_S = module.S * module.expert_vector
        # Reconstruct weight with modified S
        W_modified = module.U @ torch.diag(modified_S) @ module.Vh
        # Return modified output
        return F.linear(input[0], W_modified, module.bias)
    
    layer.register_forward_hook(forward_hook)
```

### 3. Train Real Expert Vectors

```python
def train_expert_vector(model, dataset, expert_name, learning_rate=1e-4, epochs=3):
    """Train an expert vector on a specific domain dataset."""
    # Initialize expert vector as ones (identity transformation)
    expert_vector = {
        layer_name: torch.ones_like(layer.S) 
        for layer_name, layer in get_svd_layers(model)
    }
    
    # Optimizer that only updates the expert vector, not the base model
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam([expert_vector[name] for name in expert_vector], lr=learning_rate)
    
    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for batch in dataloader:
            # Forward pass with expert vector
            outputs = model(**batch, expert_vector=expert_vector)
            loss = outputs.loss
            
            # Backward pass and update
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    # Save trained expert vector
    torch.save(expert_vector, f"experts/vectors/{expert_name}/expert.pt")
```

### 4. Build a Real Embedding System

```python
def get_prompt_embedding(text, model):
    """Get actual semantic embedding for a prompt."""
    # Tokenize and encode
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
    
    # Get model embeddings from last hidden state
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs, output_hidden_states=True)
        # Use mean pooling over last layer
        embeddings = outputs.hidden_states[-1].mean(dim=1)
    
    return embeddings
```

### 5. Implement a Learning Memory System

```python
class AdaptiveMemory:
    def __init__(self, base_model):
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.expert_vectors = {}
        self.interaction_history = []
        
    def learn_from_interaction(self, prompt, response, feedback_score):
        """Learn from each interaction to improve future responses."""
        # Extract features from the interaction
        prompt_embedding = get_prompt_embedding(prompt, self.base_model)
        
        # Update expert vectors based on feedback
        for expert_name, expert_vector in self.expert_vectors.items():
            # Calculate influence of this expert on the response
            influence = calculate_expert_influence(expert_name, prompt_embedding)
            
            # Update expert vector based on feedback (positive reinforcement)
            if feedback_score > 0.7 and influence > 0.3:
                # Strengthen components that worked well
                self.strengthen_expert_components(expert_name, prompt_embedding)
            
        # Store interaction in history
        self.interaction_history.append({
            "prompt": prompt,
            "response": response,
            "feedback": feedback_score,
            "timestamp": time.time()
        })
        
    def strengthen_expert_components(self, expert_name, prompt_embedding):
        """Strengthen expert vector components that are relevant to the prompt."""
        # Implement gradient-based updates to specific singular values
        # based on their contribution to the response
```

### 6. Integrate with Real-world Usage and Feedback

For the system to truly learn and remember, it would need:

1. **A feedback mechanism** to evaluate response quality
2. **Long-term storage** of expert vectors and interaction history
3. **Periodic retraining** to consolidate learning
4. **A forgetting mechanism** to prioritize recent and important information

Using blended experts (no clear primary expert)
Error: The size of tensor a (512) must match the size of tensor b (256) at non-singleton dimension 0

The error you're seeing is because the expert vectors and model layers have mismatched dimensions (512 vs 256). In a real implementation, you would need to either:

1. Ensure dimensions match by adapting the expert vectors to the specific model architecture
2. Implement projection mechanisms to handle dimension mismatches
3. Train expert vectors specifically for your model architecture

## Challenges in Building a Real System

Creating a truly adaptive model involves overcoming several challenges:

1. **Catastrophic forgetting**: Ensuring new learning doesn't overwrite previous expertise
2. **Transfer learning efficiency**: Making adaptation fast with minimal data
3. **Memory limitations**: Managing the growing collection of expert vectors
4. **Computational overhead**: Balancing adaptation quality with inference speed
5. **Privacy considerations**: Handling sensitive information in the adaptation process

The mock demo provides a conceptual framework, but implementing a production-ready system would require significant engineering effort and research advancements in neural network adaptation techniques.
